# 🎬 Enhancer for YouTube – Auto Loop & Next Video Shortcuts

A custom script for **Enhancer for YouTube** that:
- Automatically enables **loop** when a video starts.
- Lets you toggle loop with the **R** key.
- Lets you skip to the next video with the **N** key (without enabling autoplay).
- Displays a clear **Loop ON/OFF** or **Next Video** toast notification with smooth fade‑in/fade‑out animation.

- **N key** – skips to the next video in the queue or playlist.
